# Multimedia 4th semester final exam
This is a redesign project for Kvindesmedien in Copenhagen.

The website is my final project for my Multimedia degree, and it is a prototype showroom for a danish blacksmith company called Kvindesmedien.
The website is responsive and it's made with PHP, Apache webserver and MySQL.
